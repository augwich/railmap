<h2>So what is this exactly?</h2>

Pretty much what it looks like. An (soon to be) interactive map of all passenger rail networks in the United States. Didn't you read the title?
<br>
But to be more precise, this map seeks to visually catalog all existing and soon-to-exist passenger rail systems across the contiguous 48 states, and Washington D.C. (Alaska, Hawaii, you'll be added eventually). 
<br>

<h2>What about [insert rail system/name/feature here]? Why isn't it on the map?</h2>

Well for starters, the map is still very much under construction. It's a slow process to comb through all the data for all these systems. So most likely if you don't see something on the map, don't worry, it's planned. I just haven't gotten there yet.
<br>
If you don't see something however and worry it may have been forgotten, see below:
<br>

<h2>I can't believe you screwed up [insert some feature that is very dear to your heart]!</h2>

First off, that's not a question!
But don't worry. There's a lot of data to go through, and for a lot of these systems I have no real-life experience using them. It's certainly likely I screwed something up. Head on over to the <a href="https://trello.com/b/GinKUKvq">Trello Board</a>, friend. I'll try and patch things up for you. 
<br>

<h2>And you are...?</h2>

Hi. I'm August. I'm just a guy who likes maps, and trains. I'm certainly not an expert in data visualization or manipulation, nor an I an expert in passenger rail. I started this map essentially because I wanted to (see below), and thought it would be cool to have. Most of what I know I have learned along the way. As such, I may have very likely gotten something wrong. 
<br>

<h2>Why do this?</h2>

Well for starters, I'm a nerd who loves maps and trains. But mostly, the idea to make this came out of my own desire to have a map like this. As someone who prefers riding trains over most other forms of public transportation, I was trying to see if there was a way to get between the cities of the Northeast (particularly Boston and NYC) without relying on Amtrak's expensive Northeast Corridor (unfortunately, as I learned, there isn't). But as I discovered, there was no good way to search or see multiple rail systems simultaneously. Sure, Google Maps and related have transit features, but they rely on getting you to your destination the quickest, and are also tied to the time in which you search. I wasn't necessarily interested in the quickest route, but simply wanted to see if there were even OPTIONS. I found some other pretty cool mapping projects (see the links below), but none of them quite did what I wanted.
<br> 
If you can't find what you need, then hey, why not make it? I dove into Mapbox and various rail data sites, and, well, here we are. 
<br>

<h2>That seems like a lot of work.</h2>

Yeah. No kidding. That's why this is a slow process. Mapping the entire U.S. passenger rail system is tedious, particularly when there's no good synthesis of data. It's a lot of time combing through individual timetables, existing maps, and Wikipedia. But hey, I enjoy it. I just ask for your patience with it all.
<br>

<h2>This is cool, but I don't live in the U.S. Can you do a map for XYZ Country?</h2>

I know, the U.S. is certainly not the only country out there with rail systems to map, and most countries across the pond have much, much better systems to boot (like actually functioning systems. Really, I'm quite jealous). Right now however, I'm focusing on the U.S. It's where I'm from, and where I'm most familiar with. Sorry. Maybe eventually I can take a look at other countries. It would be cool.
<br>
If you're interested in doing something similar for other parts of the world, let me know! I'd love to see other projects people are working on, and maybe I can lend some assistance as well.
<br>

<h2>How can I share this with other people? Are you on social media?</h2>

No social media yet, though it's in the pipeline. For now, just copy that web address, and paste away!
<br>

<h2>Where can I see upcoming features?</h2>

Check out the <a href="https://trello.com/b/GinKUKvq">Trello Board</a>. It's usually pretty up-to-date on our progress, both currently implemented features as well as planned ones. 
<br>

<h2>This is super cool and I'd love to help!</h2>

Thanks for the interest! Right now, I'm not looking to bring on additional people in any super involved capacity - while it may expedite the process somewhat, it also requires more overhead and management that I'm simply not interested in dealing with right now. However, I'd love to take your suggestions on things to add/change/etc.
<br>
If you have some specific things you could help with though, let me know. The two areas I'm most looking for help with are web integration (not my strong suit), and editing/verification of the data. You can mention me directly in a Trello comment with the @AugustDev to get in touch.
<br>

<h2>How can I get in touch with you?</h2>

Best way is through <a href="https://trello.com/b/GinKUKvq">Trello</a>, at the moment. Just mention me in a comment with @AugustDev.
<br>

<h2>Other Cool Links:</h2>
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/northeastrailmap/">A beautiful map of all rail systems in the Northeast</a>. It's not interactive and a bit out of date, unfortunately. <br>
<a href="https://www.openrailwaymap.org/">An amazingly detailed map of all rail networks across the world</a>. Includes literally every rail line that exists, and even some that no longer do. Amazingly detailed. Only shows rail <em>lines</em> (i.e. the physical rails), however, and not the passenger rail systems that run along them. <br>
<a href="http://www.railmaponline.com/USWestMap.php">A cool, interactive map of rail lines in the Western U.S.</a> Again, shows lines, not systems. But detailed, and properly interactive. Shows states west of the Rockies only. <br>
<a href="http://www.acwr.com/economic-development/rail-maps">Some cool maps of freight systems in the U.S.</a> The site and maps are a bit buggy though. <br>
<a href="https://traveler.sharemap.org/Passenger_trains_in_America">A properly interactive map of many rail systems in the US</a>. Includes Intercity (Amtrak) and most commuter rails. Does not include Urban systems (light rail, subways, etc), or any stations. Does have a feature to search and get directions along routes. Frequently breaks. Probably the closest to what I want this project to eventually be.
